  <h1>Data Analysis and Recommendation System for Movie Metadata</h1>

  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>
    This project is a data science-based analysis and recommendation system built using Python. It involves exploring and analyzing a movie metadata dataset to uncover trends in genres, ratings, and popularity.
    The project also features a <strong>content-based movie recommendation system</strong> that suggests similar movies based on genre, popularity, and user ratings.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dataset is processed to handle issues like missing values and multi-genre classification. Visualizations are created to present insightful trends, and the recommender system uses <strong>cosine similarity</strong> and <strong>feature engineering</strong> to return personalized movie recommendations.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Run the Project</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.</li>
    <li>Clone the repository or download the project folder.</li>
    <li>Install the required libraries by running:
      <pre><code>pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Open the Jupyter Notebook or your Python environment:
      <pre><code>jupyter notebook</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Run the notebook or script containing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data preprocessing</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Content-based recommendation system</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>To get recommendations, use the function:</p>
  <pre><code>get_recommendations("Movie Title", df, cosine_sim)</code></pre>

  <h2>Limitations and Scope for Improvement</h2>
  <p>
    The current recommendation model provides basic content-based results, but its accuracy and relevance are limited due to the simplicity of the features used. 
    It may not always recommend contextually appropriate or genre-consistent movies.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Future improvements could include:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Incorporating more detailed metadata like cast, director, and plot summary</li>
      <li>Using natural language processing (NLP) on movie overviews or user reviews</li>
      <li>Implementing collaborative filtering or hybrid models for better accuracy</li>
      <li>Evaluating model performance with user feedback or benchmark metrics</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
